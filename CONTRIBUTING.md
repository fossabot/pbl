# Contribution guide

Thanks for your contribute.

Many API features has not supported by python-backlog yet. Any contribution is welcome.

It would be great if you could create an issue or pull request. However, since I may not be aware of your contribution, it may help me to respond to it more reliably if you give me a Mention or let me know via twitter ([@hassaku63](https://twitter.com/hassaku_63)).

It would also be nice if you could update the number in the VERSION file in the top directory before sending a pull request.

The procedure for releasing a new version can be found here. https://github.com/hassaku63/pbl/wiki/Release-flow
